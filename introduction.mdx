## About our SDKs
Our SDKs are fully compatible with existing TypeScript SDKs, but architected and developed with careful consideration on their respective programming language. For example, **Unity SDKs (C#)** we make sure they follow object-oriented paradgims (OOP) and that the language versions are backwards compatible with Unity. Another example of this can be observed in our **Swift (iOS)** SDKs code updates to conform to [Swift 6 new standards](https://www.swift.org/migration/documentation/migrationguide/) regarding data race conditions and Sendable conformance for concurrent objects.
