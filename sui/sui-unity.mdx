The OpenDive Sui Unity SDK is the first fully-featured Unity SDK with offline transaction building.

This means that games built with our SDK can directly craft custom Move calls without relying Sui's "unsafe" RPC calls under the [Transaction Builder API](https://docs.sui.io/sui-api-ref#transaction-builder-api) -- which in turn reduces the number of RPC / Network requests. 

Our SDK fully supports mobile, desktop and WebGL application built with the Unity game engine.

## About the Project
**Sui-Unity-SDK** is a C# Unity SDK designed to provide Unity developers with a seamless and efficient way to interact with the Sui Blockchain. Our aim is to lower the barrier for Unity developers, enabling them to leverage and integrate Sui's vast and versatile ecosystem into their games without having to delve deep into the complexities of the ecosystem.

## Motivation
With the rise of Web3 technologies being leveraged for games of all genres, it is very vital that developers have access to the necessary tools to simplify the process of leveraging such technologies. While Sui has an incredible suite of capabilities, there was a clear need for a C# Unity SDK that aligns with the idiomatic practices of the engine and language, along with the expectations of such development tools.

## Our Vision
We envision a tool that not only provides the flexibility and customization for experienced Sui developers, but also provides an easy entry point for novice and beginner developers who aren't as familiar with the various complex concepts that come with Web3 development. Our ultimate goal is to foster innovation by providing Unity developers with the right tools to integrate Sui's capabilities into their applications effortlessly.

### Make Account Transfer Quickly and Easily! ###

With how easy the library is to use, Sui-Unity-SDK gives you the power to quickly setup a Sui account and be able to transfer coins in only a few lines of code:
```c#
// Initialize Accounts.
Account alice = new Account();
Account bob = new Account();

// Initialize Client and Transaction Block
SuiClient client = new SuiClient(Constants.LocalnetConnection);
TransactionBlock tx_block = new TransactionBlock();

// Call Transfer Objects
tx_block.AddTransferObjectsTx(new SuiTransactionArgument[] { tx_block.gas }, bob.SuiAddress());

// Call SignAndExecuteTransactionBlockAsync
RpcResult<TransactionBlockResponse> published_tx_block = await client.SignAndExecuteTransactionBlockAsync
(
    tx_block,
    alice
);

// Return the TransactionBlockResponse
return published_tx_block.Result;
```

<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Please install Node.js (version 19 or higher) before proceeding.
</Info>

Step 1. Install Mintlify on your OS:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to the docs are located (where you can find `mint.json`) and run the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Pro
  Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing) and above.

## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when working with the CLI.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mintlify is not loading">
    Update to Node v18. Run `mintlify install` and try again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No such file or directory on Windows">
Go to the `C:/Users/Username/.mintlify/` directory and remove the `mint`
folder. Then Open the Git Bash in this location and run `git clone
https://github.com/mintlify/mint.git`.

Repeat step 3.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Getting an unknown error">
    Try navigating to the root of your device and delete the ~/.mintlify folder.
    Then run `mintlify dev` again.
